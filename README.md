# FOCPP – Foundation of Computing Programming

## Overview

This repository contains my learning work for the **Foundation of Computing Programming (FOCPP)** module. It includes weekly programming exercises, Jupyter notebooks, and a small Python project. The purpose of this repository is to show my understanding of basic computing and Python programming concepts.

All work in this repository is created as part of my university coursework. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were used only as a **learning support**, similar to a tutor or reference book. All code was reviewed, tested, and understood by me.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised into clear folders so that it is easy to understand and review.

### 📁 By_weekly_assignment

This folder contains **weekly programming tasks and exercises** completed during the module.

* Each file represents work from a specific week
* Covers basic Python concepts step by step
* Focuses on practice and understanding rather than complexity

Topics include:

* Variables and data types
* Input and output
* Conditions (if / else)
* Loops (for / while)
* Functions
* Simple problem‑solving using Python

---

### 📁 Noteboook (Jupyter Notebooks)

This folder contains **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files** used during practical sessions.

* Code is written and executed step‑by‑step
* Includes comments and explanations
* Shows how concepts were learned gradually

These notebooks help demonstrate:

* Logical thinking
* Code testing and debugging
* Clean and readable coding style

### 📁 Project

This folder contains the **main Python project** for the module.

Project features:

* A complete Python program that can run from the command line
* Uses multiple programming concepts together
* Includes file handling, functions, and user input
* Designed to meet the module assessment requirements

Supporting files such as `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and flowcharts are included to explain how the program works.

### 📄 AI_Declaration.md

This file explains how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** tools were used in this module.

Key points:

* AI was used only to support learning
* Code was not blindly copied
* All programs were understood, modified, and tested by me
* The final work represents my own effort
