# Introduction to Programming – Week 8 Lab Summary

## Overview
This lab focuses on **Input/Output operations**, **string formatting**, and **file handling in Python**. It introduces modern formatting techniques and practical methods for reading from and writing to files.

## Basics of Input and Output
Python programs typically:
1. Take input (from users or files),
2. Process the data,
3. Produce output (to the console or files).

User input is handled using `input()` and output using `print()`.

## String Formatting

### f-Strings
- Introduced in Python 3.6
- Allow embedding variables and expressions directly inside strings using `{}`.
- Example:
  ```python
  print(f"The area is {area}")
