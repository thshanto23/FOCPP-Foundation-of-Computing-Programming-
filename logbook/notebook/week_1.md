# Introduction to Programming – Week 1 Lab Summary

## Overview
This lab introduces fundamental programming concepts using the Python language. It focuses on understanding programming language types, using the Python interpreter, writing basic expressions, handling errors, and learning key programming terminology.

## Types of Programming Languages
- **3GL (Third Generation Languages)**: General-purpose languages such as Python, C, and Java. They balance usability, efficiency, and portability.
- **4GL (Fourth Generation Languages)**: High-level, domain-specific languages like SQL and R that focus on *what* needs to be done rather than *how*.
- **Programming Paradigms**:
  - Procedural
  - Object-Oriented
  - Functional
  - Aspect-Oriented
- Python is a **multi-paradigm, interpreted 3GL language** executed using the CPython interpreter.

## Using the Python Interpreter
- Python supports **interactive mode** using the **REPL model**:
  - Read → Evaluate → Print → Loop
- The interpreter is started using:
