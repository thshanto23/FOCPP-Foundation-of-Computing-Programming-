## Week 2 – Working with Variables and Data Types

### Key Topics Covered
- Variables and identifier naming rules
- Variable assignment and augmented assignment operators
- Primitive data types: `int`, `float`, `boolean`, `string`
- Dynamic typing in Python
- Using the `type()` function to identify data types
- Built-in functions such as `print()`, `len()`, `input()`, `int()`
- String handling using single, double, and triple quotes
- Escape sequences in strings
- Indexing and slicing of strings
- Introduction to lists and list operations
- Mutable vs immutable data types

### Practical Work
- Created and updated variables using standard and augmented assignment
- Tested variable data types using the `type()` function
- Used built-in functions to display output and process input
- Converted user input from string to integer
- Practiced string concatenation and repetition
- Used escape sequences and triple-quoted strings for formatted output
- Applied indexing and slicing to strings
- Created lists and accessed elements using indexing and slicing
- Modified lists using slicing, `append()`, and concatenation

### Learning Outcomes
- Understood how variables store and update values
- Identified and used different data types correctly
- Gained confidence using built-in Python functions
- Learned how to safely handle user input
- Developed skills in string manipulation
- Understood the difference between mutable and immutable types
- Applied list operations for storing and modifying collections of data
