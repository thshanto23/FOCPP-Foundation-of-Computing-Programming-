## Writing Code in Files
- Python code can be written interactively (REPL mode) or saved in `.py` files (scripts).
- Scripts are plain text files; the `.py` suffix is required.
- Unlike REPL, scripts **do not automatically display results**—use `print()` for output.
- Functions and classes can be stored in files and reused by importing them in other programs.

**Choosing an Editor:**
- Basic editors: Notepad (Windows), vi (Linux)
- IDEs: PyCharm, IDLE, Eclipse, IntelliJ
- IDEs provide syntax highlighting, auto-completion, debugging, and execution support.
