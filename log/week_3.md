## Week 3 – Boolean Expressions and Control Structures

### Key Topics Covered
- Boolean expressions and Boolean data type (`True` / `False`)
- Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Boolean expressions using variables
- Comparing numeric, string, and list data types
- Type compatibility and type mismatch issues
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Operator precedence and use of parentheses
- Chaining relational operators
- Membership testing using `in` and `not in`
- Decision making using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Non-Boolean conditions in `if` statements
- Ternary operator expressions
- Iteration using `while` loops
- Iteration using `for` loops
- Using the `range()` function
- Loop control using `break` and `continue`
- Loop `else` clause

### Practical Work
- Evaluated Boolean expressions with relational operators
- Compared integers, strings, and lists using relational operators
- Tested logical expressions using `and`, `or`, and `not`
- Practiced operator chaining with numeric variables
- Used membership testing on strings and lists
- Implemented decision making using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Used explicit Boolean expressions in conditions
- Rewrote conditional logic using ternary operators
- Created `while` loops with conditional termination
- Used `for` loops to iterate over lists and ranges
- Generated numeric sequences using `range()` with step values
- Applied `break` to exit loops early
- Applied `continue` to skip loop iterations
- Used loop `else` to detect normal loop completion

### Learning Outcomes
- Developed a clear understanding of Boolean logic in programming
- Learned to control program flow using conditional statements
- Understood the importance of data types in expressions
- Gained confidence using loops for iteration
- Applied loop control statements to manage execution flow
- Improved ability to write clear and readable conditional logic
