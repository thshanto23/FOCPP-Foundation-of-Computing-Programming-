# Week 6 Lab Summary – Introduction to Programming

## Overview
This lab focused on expanding Python fundamentals by exploring **lists**, **list methods**, **list comprehensions**, and **tuples**. It also introduced key concepts such as **tuple packing**, **sequence unpacking**, and the differences between mutable and immutable data structures.

## List Methods
We revised the List data type and practiced using built-in methods to manipulate and access list data. Key list methods covered included:
- **append()** and **extend()** for adding elements
- **insert()**, **remove()**, and **pop()** for modifying list contents
- **clear()**, **sort()**, and **reverse()** for restructuring lists
- **index()**, **count()**, and **copy()** for accessing list information

The difference between mutator methods (which change the list) and accessor methods (which only return values) was clearly demonstrated.

## Sorting Lists
The lab explored sorting lists using:
- The **sort()** method (in-place sorting)
- The **sorted()** function (returns a new list)
- Sorting with **key arguments** and **lambda expressions**
- Case-insensitive sorting using `str.upper()`

## List Comprehensions
List comprehensions were introduced as a concise and Pythonic way to create lists. We practiced:
- Generating lists programmatically
- Using conditions (`if` statements) within comprehensions
- Creating lists such as squares, cubes, even numbers, and subsets of other lists

## Tuples
Tuples were introduced as immutable sequence types, commonly used to store related data. Topics included:
- Tuple creation and packing
- Differences between lists and tuples
- Empty and single-element tuples
- Tuple indexing and iteration

## Sequence Unpacking
Sequence unpacking was used to extract tuple values into separate variables. This concept was also applied to:
- Multiple assignment
- Returning multiple values from functions
- Passing tuple values into functions using the `*` operator

## Key Terminology
The lab reinforced understanding of the following concepts:
- **Method**
- **List Comprehension**
- **Tuple**
- **Tuple Packing**
- **Sequence Unpacking**

## Conclusion
Overall, this lab strengthened understanding of Python data structures and improved confidence in manipulating collections efficiently. These concepts are essential for writing clean, readable, and effective Python programs.
