**Level 4 – Semester 1, BSc (Hons) Computing, Leeds Beckett University**
**Module: Fundamentals of Computer Programming**

---

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks created during the weekly practical sessions for the *Fundamentals of Computer Programming* module.
Each notebook includes Python code, explanations, and exercises completed as part of the learning activities.

The notebooks are organised by week and show my progress from basic Python programming to more advanced topics such as data structures, functions, and file handling.
